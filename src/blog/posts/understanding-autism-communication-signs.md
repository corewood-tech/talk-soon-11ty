"My 2-year-old isn't talking much and doesn't seem to play the same way as other kids. Could this be autism?"

As a speech-language pathologist, I understand how overwhelming it can be when you notice differences in your child's communication and social development. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects communication, social interaction, and behavior in unique ways for each child. Early identification and intervention can make a tremendous difference in supporting your child's development.

Let's explore the communication signs of autism across different ages and how speech-language pathologists can support children and families throughout their journey.

- No shared enjoyment or social smiling

### 18-24 Months:
- Few or no words by 18 months (fewer than 10 words)

## The Importance of Early Intervention

You can often see signs and symptoms of autism in very young children, but sometimes these signs and symptoms are not very noticeable—and they might not be recognized until school age or even adulthood. This is why early screening and intervention are so crucial.

Early speech-language intervention can help children:
- Develop functional communication skills
- Reduce challenging behaviors often related to communication frustration
- Build social connections and relationships
- Prepare for academic success
- Develop independence and self-advocacy skills

## Working with Families

Speech-language pathologists don't just work with children—we partner with families to:
- Provide education about communication development
- Teach strategies for supporting communication at home
- Help families understand their child's unique communication style
- Connect families with resources and support networks
- Advocate for appropriate services and accommodations

## Beyond the Diagnosis

It's important to remember that autism is a neurological difference, and autistic individuals have valuable perspectives and contributions to share. Our role as SLPs is to support each child in developing their communication skills in ways that honor their individual strengths and needs.

We focus on:
- Supporting authentic communication, whether verbal or nonverbal
- Teaching functional skills that increase independence
- Honoring each child's unique communication style
- Preparing children for success in their chosen paths

## When to Seek Help

If you notice any combination of the red flags mentioned above, don't wait. Early screening and intervention can make a significant difference. Trust your instincts—you know your child best.

Consider seeking evaluation if:
- Your child isn't meeting communication milestones
- You notice regression in previously acquired skills
- Your child has difficulty with social communication
- Teachers or other caregivers express concerns
- Your child shows repetitive behaviors that interfere with learning or social interaction
