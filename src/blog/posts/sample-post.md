As a speech-language pathologist, one of the most common questions I receive from parents is: "Is my child developing language normally?" Understanding typical language development milestones can help you support your child's communication growth and identify when additional support might be beneficial.

## Early Language Milestones (0-12 months)

During the first year of life, babies are already developing the foundation for communication:

- **0-3 months**: Crying, cooing, and making pleasure sounds
- **4-6 months**: Babbling begins with consonant-vowel combinations like "ba-ba" or "ma-ma"
- **7-12 months**: First words typically emerge, along with understanding simple commands

## Toddler Language Development (12-24 months)

This is an exciting time for language growth:

- **12-18 months**: 10-50 words, following simple instructions
- **18-24 months**: 50-200 words, beginning to combine words into two-word phrases

## When to Seek Help

Consider consulting a speech-language pathologist if your child:

- Has fewer than 10 words by 18 months
- Isn't combining words by age 2
- Is difficult to understand by family members
- Shows frustration when trying to communicate

## Supporting Language Development at Home

Here are some simple strategies to encourage language growth:

1. **Read together daily** - Books provide rich language exposure
2. **Narrate your activities** - Describe what you're doing throughout the day
3. **Follow your child's lead** - Talk about what interests them
4. **Give them time to respond** - Wait for your child to communicate before jumping in

Remember, every child develops at their own pace, but early intervention can make a significant difference when concerns arise. If you have questions about your child's language development, don't hesitate to reach out for a consultation.
