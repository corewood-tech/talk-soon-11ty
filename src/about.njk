    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Markie, and I have been a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for 10 years. My gift in life is to help people become confident communicators. I work with all ages from birth to the elderly, but my true passion is helping kids learn to communicate. Before becoming an SLP, I was a preschool teacher for 5 years. I absolutely love helping young children become the best communicators they can be.</p>

    <p>I have extensive training and experience providing speech therapy services to children: from babies who are a few months old to 10 year olds. I know how to design and implement engaging speech therapy sessions for all ages that enable children to reach their speech and language goals. I use multi-sensory cues (touch, visual, auditory, tactile) to give feedback and instruction that helps children learn to correct their speech sound errors. I use strategies including sign language, parent coaching, and modeling to get toddlers who aren't talking (or aren't talking much) to say their first words. I help autistic kids learn to recognize and respond to the social cues around them. I provide specific instructions in research-based fluency enhancing strategies to help kids who stutter be as fluent as they want to be.</p>
    
    <p>I have a master's degree in speech-language pathology from the University of Northern Colorado. I have ASHA certification also known as CCC-SLP: Certificate of Clinical Competence Speech-language Pathology from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. I am also licensed to practice speech therapy in Colorado and a handful of other states.</p>

    <p>In the course of my career, I have worked with many varied populations. I treated elderly adults in an assisted living facility who had dementia, strokes, swallowing disorders, developmental disorders, brain trauma, and injury recovery. I have experience working with middle school students (11-14 years old) to expand their language, improve their grammar, correct their speech sound errors, learn fluency remediation (stuttering) strategies, increase their pragmatic (social) skills, and even improve their reading skills.</p>
    
    <p>I have provided direct in-person speech therapy in preschools, elementary schools, and middle schools. I have years of experience providing virtual/telehealth speech therapy services to kids and families of all ages. I spent 4 years providing early intervention to children from infants to five years old in their homes.</p>
