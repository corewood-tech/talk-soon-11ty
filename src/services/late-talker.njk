    <h1>Late Talker Support</h1>
    
    <p>Is your child not speaking as much as other children their age? You're not alone, and there's help available. Every child develops at their own pace, but sometimes a little extra support can make all the difference.</p>
    
    <h2>What is a Late Talker?</h2>
    <p>A late talker is typically a child who:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
        <li>Has fewer than 50 words by age 2</li>
        <li>Is not combining words by age 2.5</li>
        <li>Has difficulty being understood by family members</li>
        <li>Shows frustration when trying to communicate</li>
    </ul>
