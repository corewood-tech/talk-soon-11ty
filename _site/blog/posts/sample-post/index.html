            <p>As a speech-language pathologist, one of the most common questions I receive from parents is: &quot;Is my child developing language normally?&quot; Understanding typical language development milestones can help you support your child's communication growth and identify when additional support might be beneficial.</p>
<h2>Early Language Milestones (0-12 months)</h2>
<p>During the first year of life, babies are already developing the foundation for communication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0-3 months</strong>: Crying, cooing, and making pleasure sounds</li>
<li><strong>4-6 months</strong>: Babbling begins with consonant-vowel combinations like &quot;ba-ba&quot; or &quot;ma-ma&quot;</li>
<li><strong>7-12 months</strong>: First words typically emerge, along with understanding simple commands</li>
</ul>
<h2>Toddler Language Development (12-24 months)</h2>
<p>This is an exciting time for language growth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>12-18 months</strong>: 10-50 words, following simple instructions</li>
<li><strong>18-24 months</strong>: 50-200 words, beginning to combine words into two-word phrases</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
<p>Consider consulting a speech-language pathologist if your child:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has fewer than 10 words by 18 months</li>
<li>Isn't combining words by age 2</li>
<li>Is difficult to understand by family members</li>
<li>Shows frustration when trying to communicate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Supporting Language Development at Home</h2>
<p>Here are some simple strategies to encourage language growth:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read together daily</strong> - Books provide rich language exposure</li>
<li><strong>Narrate your activities</strong> - Describe what you're doing throughout the day</li>
<li><strong>Follow your child's lead</strong> - Talk about what interests them</li>
<li><strong>Give them time to respond</strong> - Wait for your child to communicate before jumping in</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, every child develops at their own pace, but early intervention can make a significant difference when concerns arise. If you have questions about your child's language development, don't hesitate to reach out for a consultation.</p>
